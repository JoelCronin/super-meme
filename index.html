                    <p>Hi, Im Joel Cronin, currently studying to become a Software Engineer with the University of Toronto's Coding Bootcamp. During this course I will learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages. I also have acquired great experience in API design and am comfortable with JSON, AJAX and REST</p> <br>
                    <p>Originally from London, UK I moved to Toronto in March 2022. In London I was a Mechanical and Electrical Engineer for 7 years with London Underground but have decided to transition into software development. </p>

                    <p>In my first project, the client 'Horiseon' approched me to refactor their code for their websites homepage in order to mazimize their SEO. When looking throgh their code it also became clear that their CSS styling needed to be consolidated and there were also some non-functioning links that needed fixing.</p>
